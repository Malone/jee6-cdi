= Introduction =

There is no standard interface to doing CDI SE. 
We would like this for the tutorial series so folks can download the tutorials and get them to work
with their CDI container of choice. This will also be useful for unit testing.

[http://seamframework.org/Weld Weld] has a way. 
[http://caucho.com/resin-4.0/ Caucho Resin] has a way. 
And, we assume [http://openwebbeans.apache.org/ Apache OpenWebBeans] has a way.

We are most familiar with Resin and Weld so we will start with them.

= Design goals =

 * Single interface for looking up beans by annotation and name 
 * Single callback for being notified when the container starts up (nice to have for now)

The goals may change as we progress. For now, we want this to work with both Resin and Weld. In the future, we will get it to work with OpenWebBeans.

For now, we just want a standard way to host our examples for our tutorials series.

The vision is as follows:

 * Create a github account for this project to host this common interface for CDI SE
 * Host a maven repository here at this project site which will host this artifact
 * Change tutorial to use this maven repo as a repository
 * Add items to the common lib as needed
 * To keep the maven pom.xml files simple, we will branch the tutorial into three branches, 
      ** one for Resin
     ** one for Weld
     ** one for OpenWebBeans
 * End user will use the branch based on the CDI SE container they are interested in

For now this new artifact will be called org.github.cdiadvocate:cdise.
